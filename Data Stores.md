# Data Stores
## Definition-1
A datastore is a repository for storing, managing and distributing data sets on an enterprise level. It is a broad term that incorporates all types of data that is produced, stored and used by an organization. The term references data that is at rest and used by one or more data-driven applications, services or individuals.

A datastore may include data from end user database applications, files or documents, or the random data property of an organization or an information system. Datastore data may be structured, unstructured or in another electronic format.

## Definition-2
A data store is a repository for persistently storing and managing collections of data which include not just repositories like databases, but also simpler store types such as simple files, emails etc.

### Types
Data store can refer to a broad class of storage systems including:
- Paper files
- Simple files like a spreadsheet
- File systems
- Email storage systems (both server and client systems)
- Databases
	- Relational databases, based on the relational model of data
	- Object-oriented databases. They can save objects of an object-oriented design.
	- NoSQL databases
		- Key-value databases
		- Wide Column Store
- Distributed data stores
- Directory services
- VMware uses the term datastore to refer to a file that stores a virtual machine

# Distributed Data Store
## Definition
A distributed data store is a computer network where information is stored on more than one node, often in a replicated fashion. It is usually specifically used to refer to either a distributed database where users store information on a number of nodes, or a computer network in which users store information on a number of peer network nodes.

## Peer network node data stores
In peer network data stores, the user can usually reciprocate and allow other users to use their computer as a storage node as well. Information may or may not be accessible to other users depending on the design of the network.

Most peer-to-peer networks do not have distributed data stores in that the user's data is only available when their node is on the network. However, this distinction is somewhat blurred in a system such as BitTorrent, where it is possible for the originating node to go offline but the content to continue to be served. Still, this is only the case for individual files requested by the redistributors, as contrasted with networks such as Freenet, Winny, Share and Perfect Dark where any node may be storing any part of the files on the network.

Distributed data stores typically use an error detection and correction technique. Some distributed data stores (such as Parchive over NNTP) use forward error correction techniques to recover the original file when parts of that file are damaged or unavailable. Others try again to download that file from a different mirror.

## Examples of Peer network node data stores
- BitTorrent
- Blockchain (database)
- Chord project
- Freenet
- GNUnet
- IPFS
- Mnet
- Napster
- NNTP (the distributed data storage protocol used for Usenet news)
- Unity, of the software Perfect Dark
- Share
- Storage@home
- STORJ
- Tahoe-LAFS
- Winny
- ZeroNet
